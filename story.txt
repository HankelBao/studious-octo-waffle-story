Studious Octo Waffle Story
--------------------------
	There was once a really studious boy named Octo, who worked at a resteraunt named the 
International House of Waffles. Even though, Octo wasn't very wealthy, he had a lot of ambition for 
his future. To achieve his dreams, he would study a variety of different subjects whenever he had a 
break from his boring job of making waffles.
